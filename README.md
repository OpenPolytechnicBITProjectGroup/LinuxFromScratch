# LinuxFromScratch

## A repository to store the documentation for building a LinuxOS from a Slackware install

### Not for the faint-hearted Linux user

It would be suggestested that you are reasonably adept at bash, have an understanding of the linux file system and have good knowledge of the packages required to build a distro under Linux.

## Our Set up

To test our distro, we decided to utilise slackware run inside a virtual machine.
1. The slackware iso is available from http://www.slackware.com/getslack/torrents.php we choose to use the 64-bit x86_64 iso, which includes full source code
2. We used virtualbox as our virtual machine manager available from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads and follow your distro downlaod instructions
3. Once the virtualbox image is ready to launch, folow the instructions from `/Install on VMWare (basic)` to install slackware in the VM
4. The next steps will be featured in then next file SetupSlack.md
