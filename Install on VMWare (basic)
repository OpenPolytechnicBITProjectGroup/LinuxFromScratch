From boot screen 
boot:

[press enter we are not using new kernels yet]

Keyboard map is US

[press enter]

Slackware login 

root:

root [enter]

-- creating partitions --

cfdisk (easy paritition manager)

Creating first partition:

label type: dos
Select free space [enter]
Partition size: 8GB 
(this is going to be our boot partition, it's where new kernels are stored too)
Select: [primary]

SDA1 [boot] has been created:
/dev/sda1 has been created (but not written)
Highlight [bootable] and press enter to tag BOOT as *

Select Free Space again.
New [Enter]
2GB [Primary]

SDA2 [swap] has been created (but is not a swap space yet):
/dev/sda2 has been created (but not written)
Select [Type] and select 82 [Linux Swap] (we can talk about location of swap drive if we have alternative drive setups)

Select Free Space again.
New [Enter]
Remaining [Primary]

SDA3 [Main Drive] has been created (where all our stuff goes)
/dev/sda3 has been created (but not written)

Select [Write] and press [Enter] then 'yes' then [Quit]


Back to ROOT# 
setup [enter]

ADDSWAP (we're setting the swap drive using the menu; this can be done with the swapon command also)
TARGET /dev/sda3 (this is our location for the root /) [Format] to [ext4] (standard journaling system)
FSTAB (we're not making a new fstab location, we don't have multiple harddrives so just select continue)
INSTALL from a Slackware CD or DVD (standard)
AUTO (finds install location, doesn't hurt)

PACKAGE SERIES SELECTION 
(Here we thin out ur system. I install everything.)

I remove:

[ ] Games
[ ] XFCE Desktop (we'll go with KDE due to it's support and available software, XFCE is too light)

The rest is stuff we will no dobut at some point poke at, and can sort through later.


SELECT PROMPTING MODE 

(FOR NOW) We are going to select 'full'. There is a 'newbie' mode that we can look at later when we are thinning out the OS and removing unnecessary packages. FULL Installs 9GB but Newbie specifically states 'the X series takes one year) it will take several hours to line by line install slack. Useful later when we *know* what we are looking at.

Fortunately the install specifics are well documented and are available to acquire at any other given time easily.

LILO (simple install we're using it to facilitate the boot loader that doesn't exist currently)
STANDARD (boring linux console)

PASS PARAMS KERNEL (nope)
USE UTF-8 TEXT CONSOLE? (nope)
LILO DESTINATION (MBR obvious place)
MOUSE CONFIGURATION (I set this to USB, you can set it to PS/2 and wrap it but if you use USB you can get Virtualbox to directly capture the mouse input later if need be)
SETUP NETWORK (yes)
GPM (Yes; gives you a mouse pointer in CMD)
HOSTNAME (hostname)
DOMAIN NAME (anything doesn't matter)
CONFIGURATION TYPE (I use Network Manager; it utilizes the DAEMON to control the network switch overs / connections)
ITEMS TO START ON BOOT (Default; have a look through it)
CUSTOM SCREEN FONTS (YES, have a look through the menu find something you like I like [lat4a-19.psfu.gz])
HARDWARE CLOCK (prob local time)
TIMEZONE [Pacific/Auckland]
SELECT DEFAULT WINDOW MANAGER [initrc.kde] (for now, we have alternatives to look at later)

ADD ROOT PASSWORD []
